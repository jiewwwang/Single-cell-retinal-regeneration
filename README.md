# Single-cell-retinal-regeneration
10x Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the study of retinal regeneration.

The matrix of raw counts (in .mtx format) can be downloaded in here:
http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/jiewang/Zebrafish_NMDA_Count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish NMDA treatment),
http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/jiewang/Zebrafish_LD_Count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish light damage),
http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/jiewang/Zebrafish_TNFa_Count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish T+R treatment),
http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/jiewang/Chick_Count_matrix.mtx (Chick NMDA or growth factor treatment).

The files 'Zebrafish_Gene_features.tsv', 'Mouse_Gene_features.tsv' and 'Chick_Gene_features.tsv' separately contain the features of genes in zebrafish, mouse and chick. 
The files 'Zebrafish_NMDA_Cell_features.tsv', 'Zebrafish_LD_Cell_features.tsv' and 'Zebrafish_TNFa_Cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in zebrafish from NMDA treatment, light damage and T+R treatment, respectively. 
The file 'Chick_Cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in chick NMDA or growth factor treatment.
