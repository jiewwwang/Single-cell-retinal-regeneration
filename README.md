# Single-cell-retinal-regeneration
10x Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the study of retinal regeneration.

The matrix of raw counts (in .mtx format) can be downloaded in here /srv/www/htdocs/jiewang/scRNAseq_count_matrix/
Mouse_NMDA_count_matrix.mtx (Mouse NMDA treatment)
Mouse_LD_count_matrix.mtx (Mouse light damage treatment)
Zebrafish_NMDA_count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish NMDA treatment),
Zebrafish_LD_count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish light damage),
Zebrafish_TNFa_count_matrix.mtx (Zebrafish T+R treatment),
Chick_NMDAandGF_count_matrix.mtx (Chick NMDA or growth factor treatment).

The files 'Zebrafish_gene_features.tsv', 'Mouse_gene_features.tsv' and 'Chick_gene_features.tsv' separately contain the features of genes in zebrafish, mouse and chick. 

The files 'Zebrafish_NMDA_cell_features.tsv', 'Zebrafish_LD_cell_features.tsv' and 'Zebrafish_TNFa_cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in zebrafish from NMDA treatment, light damage and T+R treatment, respectively. 

The file 'Chick_Cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in chick NMDA or growth factor treatment.
