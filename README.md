The files 'Zebrafish_Gene_features.tsv', 'Mouse_Gene_features.tsv' and 'Chick_Gene_features.tsv' separately contain the features of genes in zebrafish, mouse and chick. 
The files 'Zebrafish_NMDA_Cell_features.tsv', 'Zebrafish_Dl_Cell_features.tsv' and 'Zebrafish_TNFa_Cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in zebrafish from NMDA treatment, light damage and T+R treatment, respectively. 
The files and 'Chick_Cell_features.tsv' contain the features of cells in chick.
